# Project Name: Currency Detection
##  Project Overview:

The project focuses on extracting currency information from documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. The goal is to accurately detect and extract currency types such as dollar, euro, yen, rupee, etc., from various documents.

## Technologies Used:

**OCR Technology**: OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is utilized for text extraction from documents.
**MINDEE OCR**: MINDEE OCR is recommended for text extraction, especially for documents containing tables or images.
**PADDLE OCR**: PADDLE OCR is suggested as an alternative for accurate text extraction.

## Task Description:

**Text Extraction**: Implement text extraction using OCR technology to extract currency-related information from documents.
**Currency Detection**: Develop algorithms to accurately detect and extract currency types present in the extracted text.
**Handling Document Formats**: Ensure the OCR system can handle various document formats, including those containing tables or images, for robust extraction.

## Notebook File:

A notebook file containing code implementations and modifications for the project will be provided. This notebook will include code for text extraction, currency detection algorithms, and integration with OCR technologies like MINDEE or PADDLE OCR.

**Recommendations**:

Utilize MINDEE OCR or PADDLE OCR for text extraction, as they perform well even with documents containing tables or images.
Implement robust algorithms for currency detection to accurately identify and extract currency types from the extracted text.

**Future Considerations**:

Explore other OCR technologies or improvements in existing OCR systems for better text extraction performance.
Enhance currency detection algorithms for improved accuracy and efficiency.
